    This is a subtle yet richly flavored curry that complements shrimp perfectly. A very authentic taste, and a very easy meal to prepare when you are in a hurry. Make sure you pop the shrimp tails off before adding to skillet. Serve with rice.

    I love making this when I have a craving for shrimp. Use Indian-style chile powder or ground red chiles for this recipe, not the Mexican spice blend!
